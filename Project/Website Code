  <!-- The biography is actually the hardest part, don't know what to say -->
    <p> Hello, my name is Kaui Sierra, I'm 21 years old, I'm a student at UCF and am currently studying Game Design. I grew up in Orlando and moved to Cocoa with my family at a young age where I
    still live. I went to school at Cocoa High where I graduated in 2019. Afterwards, I went to go study engineering at Eastern Florida State College before I decided to change majors and study Game Design.
    My favorite things to do in my spare time involve drawing, surfing, skating, and playing video games. These are all things I grew up doing and are the things that really stuck with me up until now.</p>

    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetsuya_Takahashi" target="_blank">Tetsuya Takahashi</li></a>
    <p> Takahashi is one of my favorite game developers and storytellers of all time, his Xenoblade series is one of the most heartfelt and stunning stories I've ever had the joy of experiencing.
        He's one of the people I look up to and would absolutely love to meet him one day.</p>
    <li><a href "https://www.riotgames.com/en/who-we-are" target="_blank">Riot Games</li></a>
    <p> Riot Games has made games like League of Legends and Valorant, both of which I play way too much. Their art direction and their skin lines is what really draws me towards them.
        They have some of the best art i've seen and would love to get to work with them on it.</p>
    <li><a href="https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/" target="_blank">Valve</li></a>
    <p> Vavle is another game developer company that has been a big part of my life. Their program Steam has most of the games i've played growing up. They're such a big inspiration to me and have had huge
        impacts on me. </p>
